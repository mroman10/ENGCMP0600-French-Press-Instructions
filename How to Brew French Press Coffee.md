# How to Brew a Cup of French Press Coffee
###### by Maya Rom√°n
There are many ways to make a good cup of coffee, the following are instructions for making coffee with a french press. This method produces coffee that is more "full bodied" than typical drip coffee.
#### Required Materials/Ingredients
  - a french press
  - water, enough to fill your french press plus some more
  - a measuring cup
  - a kettle/some way to boil water
  - a 1 Tbsp measuring spoon
  - a coffee grinder
  - whole coffee beans
    - **if you don't have a coffee grinder, most grocery stores have grinders you can use in the coffee section -  in that case, read Step 3 before you go shopping**
  - a long spoon (or other long utensil)
  - your favorite mug
  - your coffee additions of choice *(half & half, 2%, chocolate milk, oat milk, sugar, splenda, etc.)*

#### Step 1: Calculate
The quantity of grounds and amount of water needed depends on the size of your french press and your preference for coffee strength. Use [this calculator](https://handground.com/french-press-coffee-to-water-ratio-calculator) to determine how much coffee to grind and how much water you'll need.
#### Step 2: Boil
Measure out the amount of water calculated in Step 1 with your measuring cup. Pour the water into your kettle and set it to boil.
#### Step 3: Grind
Measure and grind your determined amount of whole beans coarsely. There shouldn't be whole or even halves of beans left, but the grounds should be much chunkier than pre-ground coffee from the store. 

Pro-tip: if you have a blade grinder, shake the grinder while you grind the beans to get more consistently sized grounds.

If you don't have a coffee grinder, you can use the coffee grinder at the grocery store and use its coarse setting. 
#### Step 4: Prep Carafe
Take the press/plunger part out of the french press, and fill up the carafe/beaker with hot water from the tap. Let it sit for a few minutes and pour the water out. Pour your coffee grounds into the carafe. Warming up the carafe beforehand helps the coffee stay hot longer.
#### Step 5: Bloom
Once the water in the kettle has boiled, slowly pour water into the carafe, but only enough to soak the grounds. Let the grounds sit for about 20 seconds. This allows the coffee to bloom, or release the carbon dioxide that gets trapped during roasting. You may see bubbles come up around the grounds, evidence of the carbon dioxide escaping. When carbon dioxide stays trapped in the coffee, it creates a more acidic (generally less tasty) flavor.
#### Step 6: Begin Brewing
Slowly continue to pour the rest of the water from the kettle over the coffee, using your long spoon or other long utensil to stir the grounds as you pour.
#### Step 7: Wait
Let the coffee sit for about 3-4 minutes. The more coffee you make, the more you can experiment to find your optimal brewing time.
#### Step 8: Press
Put the press at the top of the carafe, and slowly plunge it down. When you feel resistance, stop pushing - you don't want to break anything.
#### Step 9: Enjoy
Pour your fresh coffee into your favorite mug, add your coffee additions of choice, and enjoy!
#### Step 10: Cleanup
Make sure to clean your french press, particularly the plunger assembly, thoroughly after you finish your coffee. Some brands allow you to separate the filters and plates on the end of the plunger, so make sure to take it apart and clean each part separately so that each batch is as fresh as the first.
